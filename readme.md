## Temp World
A plugin to generate temporary worlds for testing and other purposes.

### Commands
`/tempworld [name]` - Create a temporary world. `name` field is optional.
> Note: Creating worlds is extremely heavy and thus there is a 10 second global cooldown so you don't nuke your servers

`/worlds` - List all available temporary worlds.

`/world <name>` - Teleport to a specific world based on its name.
